          BPL archives include personal papers, records of local businesses and organizations, and subject-based collections, as well as the library’s institutional records.

        <h3>What is included?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>We are in the process of adding collection descriptions to this catalog</strong> as only a portion of BPL archival collections are currently represented here.
          BPL’s finding aids have evolved over time in a range of formats; we are actively working to create more complete, equitable, and accessible collection descriptions.
        </p>
