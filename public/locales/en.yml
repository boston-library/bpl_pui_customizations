        <h4>What are archives?</h4>
        <p>
          An archival collection is a group of related materials that documents the activities of an individual, family, or organization.
          BPL archives include personal papers, records of local businesses and organizations, and subject-based collections, as well as the library’s institutional records.
          Archives at BPL are described in <strong>finding aids</strong>, which include essential information about the creation, content, arrangement, and context of these collections.
          Learn more about archives and finding aids on our <a href="help#about">Help page</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>What is included?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>We are in the process of adding collection descriptions to this catalog</strong> as only a portion of BPL archival collections are currently represented here.
          BPL’s finding aids have evolved over time in a range of formats; we are actively working to create more complete, equitable, and accessible collection descriptions.
